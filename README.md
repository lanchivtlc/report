**Featured Course Projects**

These are selected reports and projects completed during my academic studies, including both individual and group work.

- Individual Projects:

  - Database System: Designed a database for a livestock feed store. The project included two additional requirements: reading input files to analyze and generate output files that represent relationships in the input data and compute attribute closures.

  - Internet Architecture: Conducted academic research on the challenges of implementing Software-Defined Networking (SDN). The study focused on exploring and discussing the difficulties organizations face when deploying SDN despite its significant advantages.

- Group Projects: I served as the team leader, responsible for planning and task allocation. All reports were written in LaTeX.

  - Network Design: My role was to design and model the network, calculate bandwidth and traffic flow suitable for a medium-sized enterprise network.

  - Network System Administration: The project involved configuring, deploying, and managing VPNs. My work focused on configuring Site-to-Site VPN connections using both the Windows GUI and command-line interface (core configuration).
